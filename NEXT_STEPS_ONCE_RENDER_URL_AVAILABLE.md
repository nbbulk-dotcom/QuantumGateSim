# Next Steps Once Render URL is Available

## Immediate Actions (Run in Order)

### 1. Monitor Deployment Status
```bash
./monitor_render_deployment.sh https://stargate-backend-xyz.onrender.com
```
This will automatically check when the Render deployment is live and responding.

### 2. Test Backend Endpoints
```bash
./test_render_backend.sh https://stargate-backend-xyz.onrender.com
```
Verify the backend is responding with correct debug info and version.

### 3. Test WebSocket Connectivity
```bash
./test_websocket_connection.sh https://stargate-backend-xyz.onrender.com
```
Test WebSocket endpoint and verify heartbeat mechanism.

### 4. Update Frontend Configuration
```bash
./update_frontend_backend_url.sh https://stargate-backend-xyz.onrender.com
```
This will:
- Update .env.production with new Render URL
- Rebuild frontend with new backend configuration
- Prepare for frontend redeployment

### 5. Redeploy Frontend
After frontend is rebuilt, redeploy to:
https://stargate-scripts-assembler-4dba9wmt.devinapps.com/

### 6. End-to-End Testing
1. Open deployed frontend in browser
2. Verify WebSocket status shows "Connected"
3. Click "Initialize Simulation" button
4. Confirm all three monitors display live data:
   - Monitor 1: Portal 1 Panel
   - Monitor 2: Portal 2 Panel  
   - Monitor 3: Bridge & System Status

### 7. Stability Monitoring
Monitor WebSocket connection for 1 hour to verify:
- Connection remains stable
- Heartbeat mechanism works (60s intervals)
- Reconnection logic functions during interruptions
- No connection timeouts or errors

## Success Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Backend responds with debug info and timestamp
- [ ] WebSocket endpoint accepts connections
- [ ] Frontend shows "Connected" status
- [ ] "Initialize Simulation" triggers real-time data
- [ ] All three monitors display live simulation data
- [ ] Connection stable for 1+ hour with proper heartbeat
- [ ] Reconnection works during network interruptions

## Files Ready for Execution
All verification scripts are executable and committed to branch:
`devin/1756483751-grok-bridge-fixes`

Ready to proceed once Render backend URL is provided!
